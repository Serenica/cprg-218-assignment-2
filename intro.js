    timeline_description.innerHTML = "There is a lot that we don’t know about Comet, but the important things were known to those who mattered. Legend has it that once upon a time, a kitten named Comet was born to a cat, owned by a friend of my sister. Comet lived (hopefully happily) in that house, with his human, and his four (4!) dog relatives for an unknown number of years. At a certain point, my sister, a fellow cat enthusiast, was asked if she’d be interested in adopting Comet. Or so the story goes. Sometime around 2013, Comet entered my sister’s life, and the whole family got to enjoy her cat ownership vicariously. My sister had her Comet, and I had my allergies, and my mother had her ‘rent-a-cat’ as she calls it and that’s the way life was. And that’s how it stayed for many years. Comet stayed with my mother for many non-consecutive weeks over the next 7 years, as he aged into elderly cathood. When my sister and her husband became pregnant with her first child, my Brother-In-Law asked my Husband and I to watch Comet during the vacation they were taking with my parents before the baby came. (I unfortunately could not attend due to being in the SAIT LIT program at that time). After years of watching other people be asked to cat sit over me due to my allergies my moment had finally come, and I was so excited to have the family cat in my house. I secretly hoped that my sister and her husband would forget to ask for him and that we’d be able to keep him forever. About a week after they returned from Spain, I reluctantly reached out to my BIL to ask when we’d have to return Comet, joking about how we’d keep in forever in heartbeat. Much to my delight, Jeremy asked if I was serious. It turns out while I have the kind of allergies that can be controlled with medication and which are very outweighed by my love of cats, my BIL has the type of allergies that can cause long term lung damage, even if the symptoms of the allergies are controlled by medication. He said that if I was ok with adopting Comet and letting my sister be as involved as I was comfortable with, they were ok with Comet staying with us permanently. Which is how I came to own my first cat in 2019. There is too much left to say about Comet than will fit in this infinite webpage, but the highlights over the next few years mainly involved having a cuddle loving snuggle bug permanently attached to my body whenever was still in my home, who was always trying to eat my food and convince me he was starving and had never been fed. It was an adjustment, but at the same time, left like the missing piece of the puzzle had finally been placed. It was one of the hardest decisions my husband and I made together when we chose to end his suffering and take away his pain with the help of a vet in May 2019."

    timeline_description.innerHTML = "On March 26th, 2022, a spry young kitten was born to unknown parents. Somehow, her circumstances led her to be seeking adoption from the Calgary Humane Society on June 9th, 2022. We were grieving the loss of our beloved Comet and were ready to have some love and joy in our lives again. Our house was too quiet all the time, and we had a cat shaped hole our both of our hearts that a new cat would never fill, but we were ready to do some good for some cats who really needed kind humans and a loving home. Since Comet had some to us as an established cat who did not want or need other cats in his life, we had known that our next set of cats should be a bonded pair since around October 2019. On June 7th, my husband asked if I was ready to look at a pair of siblings at the shelter who he had fallen in love with, and while I wasn’t ready, nor would I ever be ready to replace Comet, I was ready to meet this brother and sister pair in need of adoption. We went out to the shelter to meet Gamora and Midnight but arrived too late in the day to fill out the paperwork and were told we’d need to come back on the 9th (they are always closed on Tuesdays!) to adopt them. We couldn’t get an appointment until the end of our workdays, and waited all day, anxiously checking the adoption page for both cats, waiting to see if our Gamora, and her littermate Midnight were still waiting for us. About an hour before it was time to head out for our appointment, the page updated, and Midnight had been adopted. While we were happy he had found his own ‘furever’ home, we were over the moon our girl Gamora was still waiting for us, even if she’d been separated from her siblings. She was very excited and vocal when she was us back at the shelter, and I cuddled and held her the entire time my husband filled out the paperwork. When we got her home and opened her carrier door, she took several confident steps into our home, discovered our hallway, and ran for probably the first time in her life, slamming on her brakes seconds before she gently slid into the wall at the end of the hallway. Since we brought her home our lives have been so very full of love, chaos, and joy, the kind you get from very pretty, very dumb kitty who is confident all food is HER food, regardless of whether or not it is actually food, actually for cats, or whether it’s actually just tinfoil."

    timeline_description.innerHTML = "About 6 weeks later, on August 1st, Darren and I flew back from Cuba, where we had just gotten engaged on the beach at sunset several days prior. We were very excited about the new chapter of our shared live we were embarking on, and even more excited to expand our family again! You are required to wait 6 weeks between adopting unbonded cats when you adopt, regardless of shelter, and we’d had an appointment booked for Tuesday, August 2nd, for about the last since weeks. We couldn’t believe our luck when we found the appointment - even though the shelter was usually closed on Tuesdays, it had been open for booking and we’d gotten the first slot of the day on the first full day back home after our trip. Enough time for Gamora to settle back into the house from her week at her grandparent’s place before we went and picked out her new sibling. Much to our surprise, we were awake earlier than expected Monday August 1, and were up and getting settled back into our lives and our home when the shelter called us. There had been a mistake, and the shelter was closed on Tuesday, but they had an open appointment right now if we wanted to come by NOW. And yes, yes we very much did. We said goodbye to Gamora and made our way to the shelter as fast as the speed limits and traffic would safely allow. At the shelter, did we a loop of the cat cages and rooms, and I fell in love at first glimpse with my shy little sweetheart. I told Darren which cat I wanted, and stayed at the cage with him while Darren went off and handled the paperwork. Holland, or Loki as we would immediately change his name too, had a different start than Gamora did. He had been previously adopted, and since kittens can’t be adopted until they are a certain age, he was born around the same time as Gamora. The individual who adopted him had returned him recently, after having him for a month, and he had just been made available to be adopted again after having waited the appropriate isolation period once he’d been returned to the shelter. While we know nothing about that month he’d spent with his first owner, we knew he’d been part of a litter born to a barn cat and had lived in a barn before coming to the shelter the first time. We also figured out over the next few days, weeks, and months that he was the sweetest, gentlest cuddle bug you ever did meet, and that he’d probably suffered some kitty trauma from being adopted and returned in the space of a month. He was much less sure about the adoption process than Gamora was, angrily yelling at us and vocalizing his displeasure at being confined to a carrier all the way home. He spent the first few weeks of his life at home with us and his “sister”, living in the bedroom, with me in there with him most hours of the day, and getting him used to myself, Darren, and our home before we began the bonding process between him and his sister. A few times, for enrichment, we shut Gamora in a separate room and allowed him to explore the main house and play with some of the toys out there, so that his scent and other identifiers could be noticed and picked up by Gamora."

    timeline_description.innerHTML = "Once we got both cats settled, and adjusted to living in our house with us, it was time to bond them. Or at least, get them used to each other so they could coexist, even if they weren’t friends. Some would stay it’s still a somewhat ongoing process. After several attempts to introduce them, we all finally got to a place where we were comfortable. As Loki got older, we became pretty sure he spent his month living with several, or at least one, dog. He has the mannerisms of a cat who spent their formative weeks around a dog and not other cats. He’s incredibly vocal, more like a husky than a cat. He trills and squawks quite often, and usually to let me know he’s ready for attention, or to play. His favourite activities include playing with anything that has feathers or ribbons or anything that moves fast, like a thrown toy although he does lose most of his interest once the “prey” stops moving. He is completely uninterested in any food beyond his cat bowl and luckily doesn’t see human food as food, although he has yet to meet a piece of plastic he doesn’t immediately try to consume. He enjoys being close with his sister, and with being cuddled or snuggled, but he prefers to sleep by himself on beds he’s made rather than purchased cat beds or with his humans. He would love to cuddle with his sister, but boundaries are not his strong point, and he loves his sister more than she loves him. He grew into a very smart cat, and he often plays dumb to trick my husband, or to get out of trouble. Gamora on the hand is his complete opposite. She doesn’t like to play with her humans but needs constant access to any sort of toy that crinkles and will wreak havoc and let slip the cats of war if she loses them all under the couch. She pretends to be very smart but is actually a little bit less intelligent for a cat, and often gets into trouble she doesn’t see coming, but which Loki is able to avoid. Anything that remotely resembles food, or has been close to food is fair game, and she loves to get underfoot and, in the way, while we’re cooking just in case, we aren’t keeping an eye on something yummy she can pilfer, sometimes from right off our plates. Her favourite toy is Loki, and she has been known to provoke him into a playfight, just so she can run a few stays away and start wailing so we arrive in time to see Loki chase her and chastise him for being the aggressor. While these cats are not from the same litter, nor are they quite as bonded as we hoped they’d eventually become, it is safe to say that they have grown close, and enjoy being near each other, and miss the other."
